            <h4>Privacy Policy for 'Chennai Weather' Android App</h4>
            <p>
            I, Sriram, developed the 'Chennai Weather' app as a free app. This service is provided by me and is intended for use as is.
            <br/><br/>
            This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
            <br/><br/>
            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Information Collection and Use</b>
            <br/><br/>
            The app does not collect any user data or personal information. The app does not access, store, or transmit any user data including personal information, device information, or usage patterns. Your use of the app is entirely private, and you can use its features without concerns about your data being collected or shared.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Log Data</b>
            <br/><br/>
            The app does not log any data regarding user activities. The log tracks the errors in the code during runtime and it does not contain any sensitive user information.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Security</b>
            <br/><br/>
            The security of your information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Misrepresentation</b>
            <br/><br/>
            This app does not impersonate any person or organisation, or misrepresent or conceal their ownership or primary purpose.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Links to Other Sites</b>
            <br/><br/>
            This app may include links to my GitHub profile or external websites. However, I do not collect any information from you when you interact with these links.
